# Search and Rescue Drones
### Summary

This repo is software to simulate (and in the future control) search and rescue drones. The intention is to connect the search & rescue pathfinding with ardupilot in future.

Object detection software will be needed to identify lost souls from a camera feed, and possibly also from infra-red camera feed too.
